These are a few 6502 assembler reference examples.

The assembler examples in this folder may require 
ca65 or other 6502 assemblers.  But these are provided as valid
X16 compatible assembler programs.

For a set of on-system CX16ASSEMBLER compatible assembler examples, 
refer to the /DEV/CX16ASSEMBLER folder.

Note that at this time of packaging, CX16ASSEMBLER 
does not yet support the STZ 65C02 opcode.
