ÏTHERWISE, THE MOUSE WILL BE VERY     HARD TO USE IN THE EMULATOR, MAKING THE GAME DIFFICULT TO     PLAY.ÔHANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO READ THE MANUAL AS IT SEEMS    IN TODAY'S WORLD, NOBODY BOTHERS TO DO THAT, PREFERRING TO     COMPLAIN THAT A GAME IS TOO HARD. ÐLANET Ø16 HAS BEEN    CREATED FROM SCRATCH FOR THE ÃOMMANDER Ø16. ÉT BORROWS A    LOT OF ELEMENTS AND GRAPHICS FROM ÐLANET Ø3, BUT THERE IS    ABSOLUTELY NO CODE IN COMMON BETWEEN THEM.  ÉF YOU ARE    FAMILIAR WITH ÐLANET Ø3, YOU MAY NEED TO RELEARN SOME    THINGS AS THE GAMEPLAY IS NOT 100% THE SAME EITHER.ÇENERAL ÃONTROL OF THE ÇAME£££££££££££££££££££££££££££ÌEFT ÃLICK          - ÓELECT ÕNIT OR ÂUILDINGÓÈÉÆÔ+ÌEFT ÃLICK    - ÓELECT ÍULTIPLE ÕNITSÄOUBLE ÌEFT ÃLICK   - ÓELECT ALL SIMILAR UNITS IN VIEWÒIGHT ÃLICK ON ÍAP  - ÔELL UNIT(S) TO GO THERE.ÒIGHT ÃLICK ON ÅNEMY- ÔELL UNIT(S) TO ATTACK UNIT OR BUILDINGÅSCAPE              - ÁBORT WHATEVER UNIT/BUILDING IS DOINGÁ                   - ÁTTACK UNIT, BUILDING, OR TERRAINÌEFT ÃLICK ÍINI-MAP - ÃHANGE VIEW AREA TO THAT PART OF MAPÒIGHT ÃLICK ÍINI-ÍAP- ÓEND SELECTED UNIT(S) TO THAT AREAÍOUSE AT ÓCREEN ÅDGE- ÓCROLL ÖIEWING ÁREAÃURSOR ËEYS         - ÓCROLL ÖIEWING ÁREAÁDDITIONALLY, WHEN PLACING A STRUCTURE, YOU CAN PRESS ÅÓÃ OR RIGHT-CLICK TO ABORT BUILDING THE STRUCTUREÆIRST ÐRIORITIES££££££££££££££££ÙOU HAVE BETWEEN 9 AND 10 MINUTES BEFORE THE ENEMY WILL     ATTACK.  ÕSE THAT TIME TO START HARVESTING RESOURCES AND    BUILDING UP DEFENSES.ÍINERALS - ÙOU WILL NEED TO BUILD A SMELTER (ÈOTKEY Ô) NEAR     WHERE YOU SEE ROCKS AND CRYSTALS.  ÕSE THE BUILDER TO PICK     UP MINERALS AND DROP THEM ALONG SIDES OF THE SMELTER     BUILDING.  ÔHE SMELTER WILL AUTOMATICALLY PICK THEM UP AND     PROCESS THEM AS IT NEEDS.     ÓTART WITH THE CRYSTALS FIRST, AS THEY ARE THE HIGHEST     VALUE RESOURCES.  ×HEN THOSE RUN OUT, YOU CAN PROCESS THE     ROCKS, STARTING FROM THE LARGEST TO THE SMALLEST.ÓOLAR ÐOWER - ÙOU WILL FIRST NEED TO BUILD A POWER STATION     (HOTKEY Á) SOMEWHERE ON THE MAP.  ÏNCE IT IS FINISHED, YOU     CAN BUILD UP TO 8 SOLAR PANELS AROUND THE POWER STATION.      ÉF YOU NEED MORE THAN 8 PANELS (WHICH YOU PROBABLY WILL)     THEN BUILD AN ADDITIONAL POWER STATION.ÇAS ÒEFINERY - ÂUILD THE REFINERY (HOTKEY Ç) ON TOP OF     VOLCANOS.  ÔHE MORE VOLCANOES YOU TAP, THE MORE GAS YOU'LL     HAVE AVAILABLE.ÓETUP ÄEFENSES££££££££££££££    ÙOU CAN MOVE ROCKS OR BUILD WALLS TO FORTIFY THE AREAS     MOST VULNERABLE TO ATTACK.  ÔHEN, BUILD SENTRY TANKS AT THE    FACTORY AND MOVE THEN A FEW SPACES BEHIND YOUR WALL, AS     THEY HAVE A VERY LONG FIRING RANGE.  ÂE SURE TO SET THEM     TO SENTRY MODE (HOTKEY Ó).  ÉF THEY AREN'T SPINNING, THEN     THEY AREN'T GOING TO DEFEND!ÂUILD A ÒADAR ÓTATION£££££££££££££££££££££    ÔHIS GAME DOES NOT EMPLOY A FOG OF WAR, AND YOU CAN ALWAYS    SEE ANYTHING IN THE MAIN VIEW AREA.  ÈOWEVER, IF YOU WANT TO    BE ABLE TO SEE BOTH PLAYER AND ENEMY MOBILE UNITS LIVE ON     THE MINI-MAP, A RADAR STATION MUST BE PRESENT. ÐLAYER UNITS    SHOW UP IN WHITE, WHILE ÐROTOID UNITS ARE YELLOW.ÂALANCE OF ÕNITS££££££££££££££££    ÏBVIOUSLY NOT ALL UNITS ARE EQUAL.  ÓOME ARE SLOW, SOME ARE    FAST.  ÓOME ARE CHEAP, AND SOME ARE EXPENSIVE.  Á SMALL    GROUP OF HEAVY TANKS, FOR EXAMPLE, COULD DECIMATE YOUR     OPPONENT'S BASE. ÈOWEVER, THEY ARE EXPENSIVE, TAKE A LONG    TIME TO BUILD, AND THEY ARE SLOW TO MOVE.  ÏN THE FLIP SIDE    OF THAT, ÁÔÖS ARE CHEAP AND FAST, BUT NOT VERY POWERFUL.    ÉN TIME, YOU WILL LEARN WHICH UNITS ARE BEST SUITED FOR    DIFFERENT STRATEGIES.      º ÔIP - ÉF YOU SELECT THE HEADQUARTERS BUILDING, THE INFO      WINDOW WILL SHOW YOU HOW MANY UNITS AND BUILDINGS YOU      HAVE, AND HOW MANY SLOTS ARE LEFT.ÍISSILE ÓILO££££££££££££    ÍISSILES CAN DEVESTATE YOUR OPPONENTS BASE EASILY.  ÂUT BE    WARNED, THEY ARE EXPENSIVE AND SLOW TO BUILD.  ÙOU MUST    ALSO BUILD A NEW MISSILE FOR EACH LAUNCH.    ÔHE COORDINATE SYSTEM USED IS BASED ON HOW MANY SPACES     RELATIVE TO THE SILO THE TARGET IS.  ÓO, IF YOU HAVE MORE     THAN ONE MISSILE SILO, THE COORDINATES WILL NOT BE THE SAME    FOR EACH ONE.  ÁLSO THE COORDINATES ARE SHOWN IN HEXA-    DECIMAL.ÔHE ÐROTOIDS££££££££££££    ÉT IS GOOD TO KNOW YOUR ENEMY.  ÔHE ÐROTOIDS WILL TYPICALLY    NOT ATTACK YOUR BASE UNTIL THEIR ARMY HAS REACHED A CERTAIN    SIZE.  ÈOWEVER, THEY WILL ALWAYS RUSH TO DEFEND THE BASE IF    YOU ATTACK THEM.    ÔHEY AREN'T TOO BRIGHT WHEN IT COMES TO NAVIGATING THE MAP    TO ATTACK YOUR BASE.  ÈOWEVER, THEIR TANKS WILL BLAST    THROUGH TERRAIN OBJECTS THAT ARE IN THE WAY, OR EVEN BUILD    BRIDGES OVER WATER, THUS ALLOWING THE REST OF THE UNITS    A PATH TO YOUR BASE.      ÐROTOIDS DO REBUILD THEIR BASE IF PIECES OF IT ARE    DESTROYED.  ÓO DON'T WAIT TOO LONG AFTER A PARTIALLY    SUCESSFUL ATTACK, OR YOU MAY HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN.ÄIFFICULTY ÌEVELS£££££££££££££££££    ÔHERE ARE THREE DIFFICULTY LEVELS: EASY, NORMAL, AND HARD.    ÔHERE ARE NUMEROUS THINGS THAT CHANGE WITH EACH LEVEL. ÓOME    THINGS ARE SMALL, SUCH AS THE RATIO OF TANKS VS SOLDIERS    THAT ARE BUILT.  ÁLSO THE NUMBER OF SENTRY PODS THAT THE     ÐROTOIDS BUILD VARIES.  ÉT IS AS LITTLE AS 4 PODS PER BASE    IN EASY MODE, TO 12 PODS IN HARD MODE.      ÉN EASY MODE, THE PROTOIDS WILL NOT EVEN BUILD A FACTORY,     HENCE NO TANKS WILL BE MADE. ÁND WITH NO TANKS, THE ÐROTOIDS    WILL NOT CROSS WATER OR CREATE PATHS THROUGH FOREST OR    ROCKS.      ÉN HARD MODE, THE ÐROTOIDS WILL BUILD TWO BASES AT THE    START OF THE GAME.                  ¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤                §ÆREQUENTLY ÁSKED ÑUESTIONS¥                 ££££££££££££££££££££££££££[Ñ] ×HY CAN'T THE MOUSE REACH THE EDGE OF THE SCREEN?[Á] ÙOU ARE PROBABLY USING AN EMULATOR.  ÙOU WILL NEED TO     PRESS ÃÏÎÔÒÏÌ-Í TO CAPTURE THE MOUSE. ÁLTERNATIVELY, USE     THE COMMAND-LINE OPTION -CAPTURE WHEN STARTING THE EMULATOR.[Ñ] ×HY CAN'T É SCROLL THE MAP WHEN PLACING A BUILDING?[Á] ÂECAUSE RESOURCES ARE DEDUCTED THE MOMENT YOU SELECT THE     STRUCTURE TO BE BUILT. ÕNFORTUNATELY THE PATHFINDING MAY     NOT BE ADEQUATE TO GET YOUR UNIT TO A FAR AWAY PLACE TO    BUILD IT.  ÉF YOU ARE FORCED TO ABORT THE BUILD, THEN YOU    WILL LOSE THOSE RESOURCES. ÔHEREFOR, IT IS BEST TO CONFINE    PLAYERS TO THE GENERAL AREA THEY WISH TO BUILD[Ñ] É CAN'T GET ENOUGH RESOURCES.[Á] ÔHEN HARVEST MORE.  ÂUILD MORE SOLAR PANELS, BUILD MORE GAS    REFINERIES, AND MAYBE AN EXTRA SMELTER. [Ñ] ÔHE SCREEN SCROLLS TOO FAST.[Á] ÙOU CAN CHANGE THE SCROLL SPEED AT THE TITLE MENU. ÏR YOU    CAN PRESS ÓÈÉÆÔ-Ò INSIDE THE GAME TO TOGGLE BETWEEN TWO    SCROLL SPEEDS.[Ñ] ÔHE ENEMY JUST OVERRUNS MY BASE TOO EASILY.[Á] ÓPEND SOME TIME FORTIFYING YOUR BASE BY BUILDING WALLS OR    MOVING ROCKS. ÐLACE SENTRY TANKS (IN SENTRY MODE) A FEW    SPACE BEHIND THE WALLS. ÈINT: TO BUILD WALLS FASTER, USE    MORE THAN ONE BUILDER.[Ñ] ÈOW DO É QUEUE UP MULTILPE UNITS TO BE BUILT?[Á] ÔHE ONLY WAY TO DO THIS IS TO BUILD MORE FACTORIES.  ÅACH    FACTORY (OR HEADQUARTERS) CAN BE BUILDING SOMETHING. [Ñ] ×HY DO MY UNITS GET STUCK OR LOST SO EASILY?[Á] ÁN 8-BIT SYSTEM DOESN'T HAVE THE HORSEPOWER TO MULTITASK    COMPLEX PATHFINDING FOR 256 SIMULTANEOUS UNITS.  ÙOU WILL    NEED TO LOWER YOUR EXPECTATIONS FOR WHAT SORT OF TERRAIN    THEY CAN NAVIGATE THROUGH.  ÒATHER THAN SENDING YOUR UNITS    DIRECTLY TO THEIR FINAL DESTINATION, SEND THEM SHORTER    DISTANCES AND HELP THEM NAVIGATE ALONG THE WAY.[Ñ] É THINK É FOUND A BUG, WHO SHOULD É CONTACT?[Á] ÆIRST, YOU SHOULD CHECK AGAINST KNOWN BUGS.
