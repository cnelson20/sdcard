                *****************************                * Planet X16 Refernce Guide *                *****************************Note to emulator users:  You will want to press CONTROL-M to     capture the mouse or start the emulator with a command-line     argument of -CAPTURE.  Otherwise, the mouse will be very     hard to use in the emulator, making the game difficult to     play.Thank you for taking the time to read the manual as it seems    in today's world, nobody bothers to do that, preferring to     complain that a game is too hard. Planet X16 has been    created from scratch for the Commander X16. It borrows a    lot of elements and graphics from Planet X3, but there is    absolutely no code in common between them.  If you are    familiar with Planet X3, you may need to relearn some    things as the gameplay is not 100% the same either.General Control of the Game---------------------------Left Click          - Select Unit or BuildingSHIFT+Left Click    - Select Multiple UnitsDouble Left Click   - Select all similar units in viewRight Click on Map  - Tell unit(s) to go there.Right Click on Enemy- Tell unit(s) to attack unit or buildingEscape              - Abort whatever unit/building is doingA                   - Attack unit, building, or terrainLeft Click Mini-map - Change view area to that part of mapRight Click Mini-Map- Send selected unit(s) to that areaMouse at Screen Edge- Scroll Viewing AreaCursor Keys         - Scroll Viewing AreaAdditionally, when placing a structure, you can press ESC or right-click to abort building the structureFirst Priorities----------------You have between 9 and 10 minutes before the enemy will     attack.  Use that time to start harvesting resources and    building up defenses.Minerals - You will need to build a smelter (Hotkey T) near     where you see rocks and crystals.  Use the builder to pick     up minerals and drop them along sides of the smelter     building.  The smelter will automatically pick them up and     process them as it needs.     Start with the crystals first, as they are the highest     value resources.  When those run out, you can process the     rocks, starting from the largest to the smallest.Solar Power - You will first need to build a power station     (hotkey A) somewhere on the map.  Once it is finished, you     can build up to 8 solar panels around the power station.      If you need more than 8 panels (which you probably will)     then build an additional power station.Gas Refinery - Build the refinery (hotkey G) on top of     volcanos.  The more volcanoes you tap, the more gas you'll     have available.Setup Defenses--------------    You can move rocks or build walls to fortify the areas     most vulnerable to attack.  Then build sentry tanks at the    factory and move then a few spaces behind your wall, as     they have a very long firing range.  Be sure to set them     to sentry mode (hotkey S).  If they aren't spinning, then     they aren't going to defend!Build a Radar Station---------------------    This game does not employ a fog of war, and you can always    see anything in the main view area.  However, if you want to    be able to see both player and enemy mobile units live on     the mini-map, a radar station must be present. Player units    show up in white, while Protoid units are yellow.Balance of Units----------------    Obviously not all units are equal.  Some are slow, some are    fast.  Some are cheap, and some are expensive.  A small    group of heavy tanks, for example, could decimate your     opponent's base. However, they are expensive, take a long    time to build, and they are slow to move.  On the flip side    of that, ATVs are cheap and fast, but not very powerful.    In time, you will learn which units are best suited for    different strategies.      * TIP - If you click on your headquarters building and look      at the info window, it will tell you how many units and      buildings you have, as well as how many slots are left.Missile Silo------------    Missiles can devestate your opponents base easily.  But be    warned, they are expensive and slow to build.  You must    also build a new missile for each launch.    The coordinate system used is based on how many spaces     relative to the silo the target is.  So, if you have more     than one missile silo, the coordinates will not be the same    for each one.  Also the coordinates are shown in hexa-    decimal.The Protoids------------    It is good to know your enemy.  The Protoids will typically    not attack your base until their army has reached a certain    size.  However, they will always rush to defend the base if    you attack them.    They aren't too bright when it comes to navigating the map    to attack your base.  However, their tanks will blast    through terrain objects that are in the way, or even build    bridges over water, thus allowing the rest of the units    a path to your base.      Protoids do rebuild their base if pieces of it are    destroyed.  So don't wait too long after a partially    sucessful attack, or you may have to start all over again.Difficulty Levels-----------------    There are three difficulty levels: easy, normal, and hard.    There are numerous things that change with each level. Some    things are small, such as the ratio of tanks vs soldiers    that are built.  Also the number of sentry pods that the     Protoids build varies.  It is as little as 4 pods per base    in easy mode, to 12 pods in hard mode.      In easy mode, the protoids will not even build a factory,     hence no tanks will be made. And with no tanks, the Protoids    will not cross water or create paths through forest or    rocks.      In hard mode, the Protoids will build two bases at the    start of the game.                 ******************************                * Frequently Asked Questions *                ******************************[Q] Why can't the mouse reach the edge of the screen?[A] You are probably using an emulator.  You will need to     press CONTROL-M to capture the mouse. Alternatively, use     the command-line option -capture when starting the emulator.[Q] Why can't I scroll the map when placing a building?[A] Because resources are deducted the moment you select the     structure to be built. Unfortunately the pathfinding may     not be adequate to get your unit to a far away place to    build it.  If you are forced to abort the build, then you    will lose those resources. Therefor, it is best to confine    players to the general area they wish to build[Q] I can't get enough resources.[A] Then harvest more.  Build more solar panels, build more gas    refineries, and maybe an extra smelter. [Q] The screen scrolls too fast.[A] You can change the scroll speed at the title menu. Or you    can press SHIFT-R inside the game to toggle between two    scroll speeds.[Q] The enemy just overruns my base too easily.[A] Spend some time fortifying your base by building walls or    moving rocks. Place sentry tanks (in sentry mode) a few    space behind the walls. Hint: to build walls faster, use    more than one builder.[Q] How do I queue up multilpe units to be built?[A] The only way to do this is to build more factories.  Each    factory can be building something. [Q] Why do my units get stuck or lost so easily?[A] An 8-bit system doesn't have the horsepower to multitask    complex pathfinding for 256 simultaneous units.  You will    need to lower your expectations for what sort of terrain    they can navigate through.  Rather than sending your units    directly to their final destination, send them shorter    distances and help them navigate along the way.[Q] I think I found a bug, who should I contact?[A] First, you should check against known bugs.  There is a     another text file included with the game called BUGLIST.TXT                *****************************                *         Appendix          *                *****************************Global Keyboard Shortcuts-------------------------Cursor Keys - Scroll view windowSHIFT-C     - Toggle high text contrast modeSHIFT-Q     - Pause/ExitRUN/STOP    - Pause/ExitSHIFT-M     - Toggle music on/offSHIFT-R     - Toggle screen scroll speedSHIFT-L     - Load a saved gameSHIFT-S     - Save your gameSPACE       - Go to map location where message was generatedTAB         - Jump to next unit on mapBuilder-------------------------ESC - AbortP   - Pick up objectD   - Drop off objectZ   - Bulldoze areaH   - Build a headquarters building.G   - Build a gas refineryA   - Build a power stationS   - Build a solar panelT   - Build a smelterF   - Build a factoryR   - Build a radarM   - Build a missile siloW   - Build a wallB   - Build a bridge (horizontal)V   - Build a bridge (vertical)Headquarters-------------------------ESC - AbortR   - RepairB   - Build a builderS   - Build a soldierFactory-------------------------ESC - AbortR   - RepairA   - Build an ATVT   - Build a tankH   - Build a heavy tankS   - Build a sentry tankMissile Silo-------------------------ESC - AbortR   - RepairB   - Build a missileL   - Launch a missileW   - Move target northA   - Move target westS   - Move target southD   - Move target eastSentry Tank-------------------------S   - Convert to sentry modeD   - Convert to drive modeMineral Yields      Yield Time---------------------------------Blue Crystal        564   FastestOrange Crystal      470      |Big Rock            376      |Medium Rock         282      |Small rock pile     188      |Small Rock          141   SlowestResources require to build-------------------------Structures      Mineral Energy  Gas----------      -------------------Headquarters    95      75      90Gas Refinery    20      15      00Smelter         42      25      22Power Station   35      29      12Solar Panel     40      17      20Factory         75      42      50Radar Station   45      25      17Missile Silo    95      70      80Wall            05      05      00Units           Mineral Energy  Gas----------      -------------------Builder         31      16      10Soldier         12      16      10Missile         99      99      99ATV             25      31      10Tank            75      60      20Heavy Tank      95      75      90Sentry Tank     75      50      20Max Health / Weapon Power-------------------------Buidlings       Health  Power----------      -------------Headquarters    238Gas Refinery    125Smelter         125Power Station   125Solar Panel     75Factory         175Radar Station   90Missile Silo    238     255Protoid Pyramid 238Protoid Cloning 238Protoid Academy 238Protoid Resrch  238 Protoid Factory 238 Protoid Sentry  100     5Units           Health  Power----------      -------------Builder         15  Soldier         25      2ATV             30      5Tank            75      12Heavy Tank      125     25Sentry Tank     75      20Giant Bug       60  Protoid Scout   25      1Protoid Soldier 35      3Protoid Tank    100     17                *****************************                *          Credits          *                *****************************David Murray    -Game Design    -6502 Coding    -User ManualBarry Yost    -Zsound sound enginePioter Radecki    -Additional Artwork    Renaud Sheidt    -Original Planet X3 ArtworkNicco1690    -Music CompositionToboter    -Beta TestingIf you need to contact somebody regarding this game, you maycontact David Murray at DFWGREENCARS@GMAIL.COM
