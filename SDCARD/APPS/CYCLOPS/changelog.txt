Version 1.1

1) Deleted read/write switch.
2) Added Input/Output Enable indicator LEDs, red=disabled, green=enabled
3) Replaced display of RAM contents, from simple byte value, to a disassembly of that byte.
4) Changed behavior of single step mode to more closely model the rising/falling edge of the system clock. Rising edge reads memory, falling edge executes instruction.
5) Write flag now follows the rising/falling edge concept and stays lit appropriately, to make it easier to follow what is going on.
6) Slowed execution of the 'slow' settting
7) Additional program optimization.
8) Added hook to run Stefan Jakobsson's X16Edit text editor, HIRAM version, if loaded, to create or edit a source file, when clicking on the filename to load a new program. Currently this must already have been loaded into memory by the user.

Version 1.2

1) Now supports both X16edit HIRAM and ROM versions.
2) additional optimizations, fastest speed is now nearly 2.5x faster than version 1.
3) various fixes.
