UPDATE 27 Oct 2023:
I reworked and removed the 14KB table. This has allowed me to:
* Increase the number of columns to 26.
* Add commands to insert and remove rows and columns.
I have also:
* Improved the performance when you aren't scrolling the screen.
* Improved the performance of file load.
* Moved to 80x30 text mode.
Not fixed:
* File load/save on real hardware.
