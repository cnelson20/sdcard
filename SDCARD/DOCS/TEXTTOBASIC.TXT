ONE WAY TO LOAD AN ASCII TEXT FILE FROM THE SD AND HAVE
IT PARSED INTO TOKENIZED BASIC...

USE BLOAD COMMAND TO BINARY LOAD THE TEXT FILE
STRAIGHT INTO A RAM BANK.  IF THE FILE IS >8K, IT WILL
AUTO INCREMENT TO THE NEXT BANK.

BLOAD ENDS BY SETTING SOME REGISTER VALUES TO 
WHICH ADDDRESS IS THE END OF THE READ FILE.  WE
CAN READ THOSE REGISTERS, AND ENSURE THAT OFFSET
IS SET TO A NULL TERMINATOR.

THEN USE THE EXEC COMMAND, WHICH WILL INVOKE STREAMING
THE BUFFERED DATA STRAIGHT INTO THE BASIC INTERPRETER.


BLOAD "MYPROGRAM.BAS",8,1,$A000
POKE PEEK($30D)+(PEEK($30E)*256),0 : REM NULL TERMINATE IN END BANK
EXEC $A000,1
