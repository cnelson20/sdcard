ÁND THANK   YOU EVEN MORE FOR READING THE MANUAL, AS IT SEEMS SO FEW   PEOPLE WILL DO THAT THESE DAYS.ÔHIS ISN'T MEANT TO BE A FULL MANUAL.  ÔHERE IS A ÐÄÆ OF THE   ÁMIGA MANUAL INCLUDED WHICH COVERS MOST OF THE GAME PLAY.    ÔHIS MANUAL WILL FILL IN SOME OF THE GAPS FOR THINGS UNIQUE TO   THE Ø16 VERSION.×ELCOME£££££££ÁTTACK OF THE ÐETSCII ÒOBOTS LOOKS, AT FIRST GLANCE, LIKE SOME  SORT OF ACTION SHOOTER GAME.  ÁND IT DOES INCORPORATE   CERTAIN FEATURES OF THOSE TYPES OF GAMES. ÈOWEVER, IT IS   ACTUALLY MORE OF A STRATEGY GAME.  ÉF YOU GO IN "GUNS   BLAZING" AND TRY TO SHOOT ALL OF THE ROBOTS, YOU WILL DIE   VERY QUICKLY.  ÆOR EACH ROBOT YOU ENCOUNTER, THERE IS AT LEAST ONE METHOD,   AND POSSIBLY SEVERAL METHODS, FOR KILLING THAT ROBOT WITHOUT   TAKING ON ANY DAMAGE YOURSELF.  ÔHIS MAY INVOLVE SOMETHING   AS SIMPLE AS SHOOTING THROUGH A WINDOW, TO SOMETHING MORE  COMPLEX SUCH AS MOVING OBJECTS AROUND IN A ROOM.                     ¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤                    § ËEYBOARD ÃONTROLS ¥                     £££££££££££££££££££ÔHERE ARE TWO WAYS TO USE THE KEYBOARD.
