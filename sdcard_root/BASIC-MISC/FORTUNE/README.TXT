This is a port of the Phil Katz 
(of PKZIP) original WoF 1984 code
that he wrote for the IBM PC BASIC.

Review and edit the MAKEDAT.PRG program
to add new categories and puzzles. That
is a BASIC program that will create
the FORTUNE.DAT file that is used to
randomly choose the game puzzle during
each round of play.

FORTUNEB.BAS (and FORTUNEB.PRG) are
the BASLOAD versions.
