This is the README file for HANGMAN. Hangman was coded from May 2023 to Feb 2024 by Anthony W. Henry in the BASIC 2.0 on theCommander X16.  There is some 'Helper' Machine code.Many people helped me out along the way. (SEE CREDITS.PRG)HANGMAN is freeware.   Anyone is free to copy any or all ofthe program code to your own projects and redistribute as theysee fit, with only one stipulation, if it is a HANGMAN gameyou are distributing then I should be credited.   If you useany of my algorithms or techniques in other programs thenI'm not worried about the credit...      This does not extend to the ML subroutines and the Music & Sound files.  I have credited the Machine Language Authorsand some of the Music contributers on my Credits screen.Other music and most of the sound effects were obtained from various free sites on the Web.   I do not own copyrightsto any of these so I cannot extend any license.  I have reasonto believe that most or all of these should be freely distributable but I do not warranty that belief in any way.         <ESC> - Exits            <Page Down> or <Down Arrow> to Continue  FILE MANIFEST  HANGMAN.INI - The main program configuration file.   TOKENIZED BASIC CODE.  (The actual program).    --------------------------------------------           CONFMENU.PRG - Configuration Menu    HANGMAN,HANGMAN.PRG - The Game itself (HANGMAN just loads HANGMAN.PRG)            CREDITS.PRG - Displays Credits   CHECKFILES,CHECKLOAD - Startup checking, and loads Machine code              ZSMLOADER - Loads the ZSMKit Music Engine                  WIPER - Does some Memory Cleanup on Exit                       PALEDITOR.PRG - The Palette Editor (Located in ALTPALETTES)  BASLOAD source code files for these are in the SOURCE directory.   ZSMKITC800.BIN is the binary for MooingLemur's ZSMKIT  music and sound library.  OTHER FILES-----------  NOOSE.DAT, FACE.DAT, LEFTARM.DAT, RIGHTARM.DAT, LEFTLEG.DAT,  RIGHTLEG.DAT, UNDER.DAT are Bitmap files used during game play.    DPAL.BIN - A VERA Palette Image holding the default color             values. <ESC> - Exits            <Page Down> or <Down Arrow> to ContinueDIRECTORY STRUCTURE------------------- ALTPALETTES - Holds some VERA palette files to change game colors.      SOUNDS - Holds general sound effect files in ZCM format       MUSIC - Holds the ZSM Music files for the game        FANF - Holds the FANFARE ZCM files (for VICTORY sounds)        EGGS - Holds the Startup Sound Snippets (Also ZCM)       ANIMS - Holds the Animation sequence for FLAWLESS VICTORY       FONTS - Holds Bitmap 8x8 fonts to be used in ISO mode               most of these roughly follow CP437 spec (IBM fonts)      SOURCE - Holds the BASLOAD source for the tokenized code.SUB FILE LISTINGS USED BY HANGMAN.PRG-------------------------------------    WORDS/HWORDS#.DAT - These make up the Game Word Database          FANFARE.DAT - File listing of VICTORY Sound Effects   MUSIC/ALLSONGS.LST - Listing of ZSM's to be played as Background Music.  MUSIC/DEADSONGS.LST - Listing of ZSM's to be played                        When the Player DIES <ESC> - Exits            <Page Down> or <Down Arrow> to Continue GAME PLAY---------HANGMAN has three play modes.        1.  Single Player against the computer                2.  Two Player with computer picking the words                3.  Head to Head Mode is Two player where the players get to             enter words for each other.             Game play is fairly self explanatory.  Letters are picked either via Keyboard or Mouse until the word is revealed or the player is HUNG !! A special animation screen is shown if a Player makes no errors on a word.                      (FLAWLESS VICTORY) A slight variation of this screen is shown for every multiple of 5 winsin a row.  (The count is reset both on a Loss and on FLAWLESS VICTORY)Sound and Music Volume are controlled during game play by the UP and DOWN Arrow Keys and the Mouse Wheel.   A Volume 'Slider' will appear while volume is being adjusted.   F12 - Will swap song play.   F5 - Cycles DRAW mode.As a general rule <ESC> will skip animations and effects or go back 1 level. <ESC> - Exits            <Page Down> or <Down Arrow> to Continue  CONFIGURATION MENU ------------------      Upon entering the Configuration Menu there are 7 option              1.            README - You are here now ;)                  2.  EDIT HANGMAN.INI - This option invokes the X16 editor                                to edit the HANGMAN.INI file                                         3.     EDIT PALETTES - Opens a Palette Editor to allow game                                palettes to be edited.                                         4.      DRAWING DEMO - Draws the HANGMAN Game scene from scratch                                and generates new game bitmaps in the                                 process.                                         5.      LOAD HANGMAN - Starts the game                  6.           CREDITS - Shows the Credits screen                  7.

Invalid lines are also ignored but can   slow down INI file processing.            For 'BOOLEAN' (Yes/No - On/Off) type INI variables.          ON,YES,1  all return '1' to the program          OFF,NO,0  all return '0' to the program          SHOWCLUE - OFF/ON  If not present it defaults to ON.  If set to OFF                        no clue is shown during game play.                       FORCEPETSCII - OFF/ON  If not present it defaults to OFF. If set to ON                       then HANGMAN will change to PETSCII mode on Startup,                       FORCEPETSCII takes precedence over FORCEISO.                        FORCEISO - OFF/ON  If not present defaults to OFF. Is overridden if                       FORCEPETSCII is ON.   Will cause the game to set                        ISO mode on startup.                                USEZSM - OFF/ON  Defaults to ON if not present.   Turns OFF loading                       of ZSMKIT if OFF.  This will disable Music and Sound.                                <CONTINUED> ON NEXT PAGE<ESC> - Exits          <Page Down> or <Down Arrow> to Continue                                 INI VARIABLES CONTINUED -----------------------    The following two INI variables control Game 'drawing' behaviour.    there are 3 modes used to draw Hangman 'Body Parts'.  These apply to the  Noose, Face, Arms & Legs.  The Torso and Gallows are always drawn by BASIC.  if neither of these INIVARs are present Hangman will use the fastest  mode by default.   Regardless of INIVAR values this can be toggled   during game play by F5.     FASTBLIT - OFF/ON  If not present defaults to ON. Is overridden                        by DRAWPARTS   If OFF the game will use the                        slower blit code that loads the bitmap file                       line by line.                            DRAWPARTS - OFF/ON  Defaults to OFF if not present.  If ON it turns                       off Blitting of body parts completely.  They                       will be drawn with BASIC graphics commands.            INI variables starting on the next page take a filename as a value. Some of them use default directory paths, some do not. HANGMAN has  not been extensively tested to see what happens if you throw NONSENSE  files at these parameters. Proceed at your own risk. If incorrect  files are used it will probably cause problems. <CONTINUED> ON NEXT PAGE<ESC> - Exits          <Page Down> or <Down Arrow> to Continue INI VARIABLES CONTINUED -----------------------          PALFILE  -  Points at a 512kb VERA Palette Image to be loaded.                Controls game Colors.  No default path. Path is relative                to the HANGMAN directory.   Default - DPAL.BIN                     MUSICDIR -  Points at the directory to search for ZSM & LST files.                Relative to the HANGMAN directory.  NO DEFAULT     INTROSONG -  Points at a ZSM file to be played during game Introduction                Sequence.  A file of up to about 400kb of size can be used                on a 512kb system, up to about 1.6mb on a 2mb system.                 BACKGROUNDTRACK - The music to play during game play.  Can be a single ZSM                  file or a .LST file holding multiple songs.  If this                   is a .LST file then F12 during game play will switch                  music.   (MUSIC/ALLSONGS.LST as distributed)     LOSSMUSIC  - The music to play on Loss Screen. Can be a single ZSM                   file or a .LST file holding multiple songs. If this                   is a .LST file then F12 on the loss screen will switch                  music. (MUSIC/DEADSONGS.LST as distributed)           <CONTINUED> ON NEXT PAGE<ESC> - Exits          <Page Down> or <Down Arrow> to Continue INI VARIABLES CONTINUED -----------------------     FONT1  - The ISO FONT File to use during most of game play in               ISO mode.  Searched for in FONTS.                   FONT2  - The ISO FONT File to use when the font changes during game               play for emphasis in ISO mode. Searched for in FONTS.                                              (Regardless of other setting.  If neither FONT1 or FONT2 are present     HANGMAN will revert to PETSCIIMODE.  In PETSCIIMODE the onboard ROM     Thick & Thin PETSCII fonts are used.)             The HANGMAN.INI file ** MUST ** be saved with Carriage Return line    endings.  NOT Line Feed.  The X16 Editor prior to ROM R47 saves with    LF's if in ISO Mode.  If invoking it from the HANGMAN Config menu   (CONFMENU.PRG)  you should be safe.  (CONFMENU checks the ROM version   and sets PETSCIIMODE if necessary.)                                   THIS IS THE END OF THE README.                                                                  <ESC> - Exits          <Page Down> or <Down Arrow>
