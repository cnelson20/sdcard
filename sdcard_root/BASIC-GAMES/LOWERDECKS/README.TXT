Commander X16: Lower Decks
voidstar - Oct. 2023

This is a capability demonstration of some of 
the possibilities of the X16 BASIC.  Features:

Self-chosen game requirements:
- Usage of SCREEN 7 (22x23 text mode)
- Exclusively played by use of the Mouse Wheel

Stretch capability demonstrations:
- Custom mouse icon
- Use of custom fonts for "graphics" and the TILE keyword
- Several simultaneous activities (facial feature updates,
  mission duration timer, power level adjustments)

NOVEMBER 2023 UPDATE:
- Fixed a few TILE color bugs when power delta was equal to 6
- Few other cleanup, and some additional "talk messages"
- Conduit damage is now RANDOM up to 4 (RED) or 2 (YELLOW),
  to be consistent with how the REPAIR is also random
- Can press SPACEBAR to stop music (SPACE again will
  enable music, but not until the next mission round)


The game does have a full set of objectives/rules.
Here we go:

CONDUITS are a component that allows the flow of electricity.
The fusion reactor can make infinite power, but you can still
damage systems by having too little or too much power allocated.
The Enterprise was launched early to impress the Vulcans,
and as a consequence it was launched without a computer
controlled Power Management System (that's right, your ship
doesn't have PMS!)!

- For the starting "0th" mission, you are at the SPACEDOCK
  which has no specific power requirements.  This is intended
  as the "rest"/relax mission, to sip your drink and prepare.
  You may later randomly return to SPACEDOCK, but the first
  starting mission will always be SPACEDOCK.

- Each mission (including the SPACEDOCK mission) has two
  parts: a REQUIRED MINIMUM DURATION then a RANDOM DURATION.
  As a Lower Deck crew, you don't have live updated status
  of the actual mission.  But near the center is a "clock diamond" 
  that indicates the REQUIRED portion of the mission.  When that
  clock icon is full, the REQUIRED portion is concluded,
  and the mission is starting to wind down (things like returning
  the shuttle back to its bay, or closing dialogs, etc.).

- This wind down period is the RANDOM DURATION, where the
  Captain is finishing up loose ends or waiting for new
  orders.  The new mission orders can come at any moment.
  If all your power allocations are "in the green", then
  during this cooldown a random number of conduits get
  repaired!  Hence you're motivated to keep systems in the
  green state.

- RED condition will damage 4 conduits (per second and per 
  subsystem).  YELLOW condition will damage 2 conduits (per second,
  per subsystem).  The power allocations don't have to be 
  100% precise, being with +/-2 or 3 increments is 
  good enough for a GREEN state.

- During a mission, your job is to use the mouse wheel and
  dial the power distribution of each sub-system to the
  NEED indicated by that department.  Some mission types will 
  have no requirements for a sub-system (but a minimum of
  one bar is needed to keep the status indication of that
  system active).

- Move the mouse to the sub-systems, and a purple highlight
  shows the selected sub-system.  Only one can be active at
  a time.  Mouse wheel up or down as needed to match the NEED
  level of that system.

- When further "off need" of that system, the faster you will
  break conduits needed to flow the power.  Too much or too 
  little power can both stress conduits and break them.

- Once you satisfy all the NEED, then during the RANDOM portion
  of the mission some conduits may get repaired (so you may 
  see the number increase).

- The objective is to avoid all conduits being broken, since at
  that point the ship can no longer function and you've failed
  at your job.


The only exception to the mouse-wheel only input is that you
can press the ESCAPE key to exit the game early.

Otherwise, the game ends when you reach below 8 conduits 
remaining.
