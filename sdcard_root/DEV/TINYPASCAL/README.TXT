THE TINYPASCAL PROJECT IS A REVIVAL OF THE 1978 BYTE MAGAZINE
THAT WAS A FULL ARTICLE OF A TINYPASCAL COMPILER IMPLEMENT IN BASIC.

WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A BASELINE TO MATCH THE COMPILER CAPABILITY
OF THAT ARTICLE, SHOWING THAT INDEED THE PROJECT DOES WORK.

MARTIN SCHMALENBACH HAS SINCE ADAPTED THE PROJECT TO BASLOAD,
ADAPTED THE ORIGINAL BASIC TO COMMANDER X16 BASIC, WHICH WILL
NOW MAKING ADDING FEATURES TO THE COMPILER POSSIBLE AFTER 45 YEARS!!!

THE USE OF PCODE SIMILAR IN CONCEPT TO JAVA BYTE CODE, WHICH
CAN EVENTUALLY BE ADAPTED TO NATIVE 6502 INSTRUCTIONS.

HOW TO USE THE TINY PASCAL COMPILER:

STEP 1:

START WITH THE COMPILER: TPCOMPILER.PRG
TINYPASCAL COMPILER
===================

LOAD"TPCOMPILER.PRG"
RUN

USE THE DEFAULTS: 
- PCODE INTO BANK 10
- SET PCODE START ADDRESS TO BE THE START OF BANK MEMORY ($A000)

YES OR NO TO DISPLAY P-CODES.  YES IS INTERESTING, BUT SLOWER.

- SPECIFY SOURCE FILE: SAMPLE.PAS

THE RESULTING FILE WILL BE WRITTEN TO:  SAMPLE.PAS.OBJ

THE .OBJ FOR NOW IS REFERRING TO "PCODE" THAT IS STILL INTERPRETED.
SO, USE THE TINYPASCAL INTERPRETER TO RUN IT!


STEP 2:

INTERPRETER
===========
LOAD "TPINTERPRETER.PRG"
RUN

USE DEFAULT:
- CONVERT ADDRESS ABOVE FROM HEX TO DECIMAL ($A000 = 40960)
- USE DEFAULT BANK OF 10
- USE OBJECT FILE OUTPUT FROM COMPILER: SAMPLE.PAS.OBJ

R<RETURN> TO RUN THE PROGRAM!
