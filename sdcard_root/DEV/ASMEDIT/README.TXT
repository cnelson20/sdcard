ASMEDIT CAN COMPILE A .SOR FILE THAT CONTAINS 6502 ASSEMBLYINTO A .PRG EXECUTABLETO RUN THE SAMPLE.PRG PRODUCED IN THE SAMPLE.SOR EXAMPLE:LOAD"SAMPLE.PRG",8,1NOTE: BOTH THE ",8,1" IS VITAL. ",8" SAYS TO USE THEFILE SYSTEM ON DEVICE #8 (DEFAULT SD).  THE ",1" SAYSTO LOAD THE CONTENT AT THE FIRST TWO BYTES OF THE PRG,BUT TO NOT INCLUDE THOSE TWO BYTES IN THE LOADED CONTENT.NOTICE THAT THE SYSTEMS TELLS YOU WHAT ADDRESS THATTHE PROGRAM IS LOADED INTO.  IN THIS CASE, THATADDRESS SHOULD BE $2000.  SO TO RUN THE PROGRAM, DO:SYS $2000ALL THIS SAMPLE PROGRAM DOES IS WRITE A 24-BIT (3 BYTE)RANDOM NUMBER INTO ADDRESS $1000.  IT THEN AUTOMATICALLYINVOKES THE SYSTEM MONITOR, SO YOU CAN TYPE "M 1000" TOVIEW THE VALUE OF THE GENERATED NUMBER (OR "M 1001" OR"M 1002" SINCE IT IS A 3-BYTE VALUE).A SIMILAR APPROACH APPLIES TO THE HELLO.SOR EXAMPLE, EXCEPTIT ORIGINATES AT $0400 INSTEAD OF $2000.  ONCE OPENED ANDCODE GENERATED, IT IS EXECUTED LIKE THIS:LOAD"HELLO.PRG",8,1SYS $0400
