This _collection_ of software is freely available for download and
individual use by the general public.

You may download and use this collection on:

* A Commander X16
* The official Commander X16 emulator
* Authorized Commander X16 clones, such as the Otter X16.

You may _not_ modify, reverse engineer, or sell this collection. Unless
separately authorized, you may not use elements of this collection in
other software collections, in whole or in part.

The software in this repository is licensed by its individual creators,
and rights for those programs are retained by the original creators.

## Submissions

We may ask you for permission to include your software in this collecton.
If you accept, you will be granting us the right to distribute your
software on the same terms as listed above. You will still own your
full Copyright, with all other rights reserved by you.

## Technical Requirements

Software submitted to this archive must meet certain performance
and reliability requirements. 

* The program must operate on a 65C02 or 65C816 CPU.
* The program must be usable on a composite monitor.
* The program must operate (not crash) if the Yamaha FM synthesizer
  is removed from the host computer.

In some cases, composite mode or operating without an FM chip
will offer reduced capabilities. For example, we don't expect a
music program to play all of the available channels if the FM chip
is not present.

If you're not sure how to implement composite-safe video and
FM-safe sound, please join us on the forums or the community 
Discord at https://www.commanderx16.com
